Disaster Response Coordination Platform

Submission Window: 48 HoursTech Stack: Candidate's Choice

Objective

Build a small backend-focused disaster response platform that allows users to create disaster incidents, resolve their locations, find nearby resources, and retrieve community reports.

The objective is to evaluate your ability to design APIs, model data, integrate external services, handle failures, optimize requests, and write maintainable code.

You are free to choose your technology stack.

1. Disaster Management

Implement APIs to:

POST   /disasters

GET    /disasters

GET    /disasters/:id

PATCH  /disasters/:id

DELETE /disasters/:id

A disaster should contain:

id

title

description

location

tags

status

created_by

created_at

updated_at

Support basic filtering, for example:

GET /disasters?tag=flood

Include basic validation and error handling.

2. Location Resolution

When creating a disaster, the system should be able to determine its location from the description.

Example:

"Heavy flooding has affected Manhattan, NYC."

The system should extract/identify:

Manhattan, NYC

and resolve it to:

latitude

longitude

You may use any suitable:

LLM/AI service

Geocoding service

Mapping provider

Mock service

External API keys are not mandatory. A clean mock/fallback implementation is acceptable.

3. Nearby Resources

Create a resource model containing:

id

name

type

location

Example resource types:

shelter

hospital

food

water

rescue

Implement:

GET /disasters/:id/resources?lat=<lat>&lng=<lng>&radius=<km>

Return resources within the requested radius.

Use an appropriate geospatial approach for your chosen database.

Explain briefly in your README how your solution performs the location-based search.

4. Community Reports

Implement:

GET /disasters/:id/reports

Reports may come from a mock external social-media service.

Example:

{

  "content": "Need drinking water near Manhattan",

  "user": "citizen123",

  "created_at": "..."

}

You do not need real Twitter/X access.

Focus on:

Fetching external data

Normalizing the response

Handling external API failures

Avoiding unnecessary repeated API calls

5. Caching

Cache the response from at least one external service.

You may use:

Redis

Database

In-memory cache

Any suitable solution

The flow should be:

Request

   ↓

Check Cache

   ↓

Cache Hit → Return Cached Data

   ↓

Cache Miss

   ↓

External Service

   ↓

Store Response

   ↓

Return Response

Use a reasonable TTL.

Briefly explain your caching strategy in the README.

6. Real-Time Update

Implement a basic real-time mechanism using:

WebSocket

Socket.IO

Server-Sent Events

Equivalent technology

Emit an event whenever a disaster is created or updated.

Example:

disaster_updated

A minimal client/test demonstrating the event is sufficient.

7. Authentication & Authorization

Implement lightweight authentication using any reasonable approach.

You may use mock users.

Example:

admin

contributor

Demonstrate at least one authorization rule.

For example:

admin → create/update/delete

contributor → create/update

A production-grade authentication system is not required.

8. What We Expect

We are primarily evaluating:

API design

Code structure

Database design

Validation

Error handling

External API integration

Caching

Geospatial querying

Real-time communication

Authentication/authorization

Testing

Engineering judgment

A polished frontend is not required.

A simple frontend, Postman collection, Swagger documentation, or API client is sufficient to demonstrate functionality.

9. Testing

Include tests for at least:

One API endpoint

One validation/error scenario

One important business rule

One external integration/mock

You do not need complete test coverage.

10. README

Your README should contain:

Setup

How to run the project locally.

Architecture

A simple diagram or explanation of the major components.

Technical Decisions

Briefly explain:

Why you selected your database

How your geospatial search works

How caching works

How external API failures are handled

Trade-offs

Mention anything you intentionally simplified or left incomplete.

AI Usage

AI coding tools such as Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. are allowed.

Mention briefly:

Tool used:

What it helped with:

What was manually implemented/modified:

We will evaluate your understanding of the submitted code, not how much code was generated.

Bonus — Optional

Implement one of the following if you have additional time:

AI-based image verification

Official disaster updates

Priority classification of reports

Interactive map

Background job/queue for external API processing

Do not sacrifice the core requirements for bonus features.

Submission

Please provide:

GitHub repository

README

.env.example

API documentation / Postman collection

Live demo, if available

Any mock data/setup scripts required to run the project

Do not commit API keys or secrets.

Final Note

You have 48 hours to submit the assignment.

We are not expecting a production-ready disaster management system.

We are interested in how you approach a real engineering problem, make technical decisions, handle edge cases, and structure your solution.

Build less. Think deeply. Explain your decisions.
